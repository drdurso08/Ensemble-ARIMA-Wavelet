# Ensemble-ARIMA-Wavelet
My masterpiece, entirely built durig my stay in Hosei University as Visiting Researcher. This will be uploaded once that is complete. 

It runs an Energy Based optimization to find the optimal decomposition level and the optimal mother wavelets, then with this informations it performs a rolling forecast with an ensemble methodology. 
Currently has a 16% MAPE v.s. a 27% of the traditional ARIMA. I'm planning to model also the residuals to see if it can enhance forecasting ability. The model is being tested on high frequency data on commodities such as gas. The goal of the dissertation is to obtain a forecast of the bid ask spread and insert this information on a optimal execution framework.
